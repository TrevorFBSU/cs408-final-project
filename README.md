# Web Dev Starter Code

## Project Spec

Open Recipe Cookbook

THEME/IDEA:
The general theme/idea for this project will be a Open Recipe Cookbook, where users can upload their cooking recipe's including photos, ingredients, steps, notes, etc... and view others based on categories or tags associated with the recipes. The users will also be able to like recipes and view by most or least likes, and even comment on other recipes.


TARGET AUDIENCE:
The ideal target audience is for those who enjoy cooking or finding new recipes to try. But this works for anyone who is intersted in new recipes or showing off their own as well.

DATA:
This project will manage data that involves recipes. Each recipe will have titles, pictures, ingredients, steps, notes, likes, and even comments. All of this will be stored on AWS and then dynamically generated based on the categories or tags searched for by the users.

STRETCH GOALS:
After the project is fully completed and functional. A stretch goal is to add a save/load capability. Or even a log in capability for reoccuring users who want to save their favorite recipes.
